### Things to Note About This Project As of Now:

1.  This currently only contains docker commands and a loan calculator that I wrote in vanilla and refactored to react
2.  PRs are welcomed if you branch correctly.
  > Any PR will need approval before merge.
3.  Collaboration will bring more features and ultimately make this more useful for everyone involved!

### TODOS

* [] Implement 'authorized users only' DB?

## SESSION STORAGE IS ACTIVE BY COOKIE AND STORED SECURELY IN MONGODB.
