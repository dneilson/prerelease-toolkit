### Things to Note About This Project As of Now:

1.  This currently only contains docker commands and a loan calculator that I wrote in vanilla and refactored to react
2.  PRs are welcomed if PR rules are followed.
3.  Collaboration will bring more features and ultimately make this more useful for everyone involved!

### PR RULES
#### ALL PRs MUST BE MADE TO DEVELOP BRANCH
1. Any PR made MUST be approved by repo owner
2. PRs not made to develop will be declined immediately

### TODOS

* [] Write up test cases.
  > currently the pass is coming from the addTwoNumbers() test. These are next on the list. Getting this migrated from CircleCI 1.0 to 2.0 and successfully wired up was the highest priority. Tests coming soon.
* [] Implement 'authorized users only' DB?
 > currently access is determined by pre-existing auth in the database. If you would like to request access, feel free to post an issue [here](https://github.com/eponymz/prerelease-toolkit/issues/new) or [email](mailto:sabeyfox@gmail.com) me directly.
* [] Write loggers and store output to mongoDB

## SESSION STORAGE IS ACTIVE BY COOKIE AND STORED SECURELY IN MONGODB.
