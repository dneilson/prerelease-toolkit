### Things to Note About This Project As of Now:

1.  This currently only contains docker commands and a loan calculator that I wrote in vanilla and refactored to react
2.  PRs are welcomed if you branch correctly.
  > Any PR will need approval before merge.
3.  Collaboration will bring more features and ultimately make this more useful for everyone involved!

### TODOS

* [] Implement 'authorized users only' DB?
 > currently access is determined by pre-existing auth in the database. If you would like to request access, feel free to post an issue [here](https://github.com/eponymz/prerelease-toolkit/issues/new) or [email](mailto:sabeyfox@gmail.com) me directly.

## SESSION STORAGE IS ACTIVE BY COOKIE AND STORED SECURELY IN MONGODB.
